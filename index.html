      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am Malav Dalal, a 32-year-old Automotive Systems and Software Safety Engineer from Farmington Hills, Michigan, USA. I come from a Vaishnav Vaniya - Gujarati Hindu family and am looking for a life partner who values family, culture, and mutual respect.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am driven, tall, and fit professional dedicated to both career success and nurturing meaningful connections. I believe in prioritizing family and have quality time with the partner. Committed to achieve balance and fulfillment in all aspects of life. Currently working as a Sr Engineer in Polaris, I am also pursuing my entrepreneurial aspirations by building a startup on the side. In my spare time, I like to explore and cook new cuisines, get on outdoor adventures and watch sport games. I like playing Tennis, Pickle-ball, and many more. I find myself satisfied being a vegetarian, non-alcoholic and non-smoking individual.
